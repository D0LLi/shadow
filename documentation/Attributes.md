# Attributes in Shadow

Attributes are similar to annotations in Java - they provide a means to attach simple, arbitrary metadata to methods for
use at compile time. Currently, they are used exclusively in "first party" contexts to enable compiler features that
might not otherwise be a good fit for dedicated keywords or syntax. Eventually, it's likely that two major additions
will be valuable:

- The ability to read attribute values at run-time
- Support for running third-party pre-processing code that consumes attributes at compile-time (a feature that Java also
  provides)

## Syntax

#### Attribute declaration

```
attribute mypackage@FooBar {
    int foo = 5;
    String bar;
}
```

No modifiers are needed (or allowed) on the attribute declaration or on its fields. Every "invocation" of an attribute
must populate all fields declared by its parent type, except for those that are populated directly on the parent type (
e.g. `foo` above) - these are considered to have a "default" value. Note that all field definitions must be compile-time
constant expressions.

#### Attribute invocation

```
class MyClass {

    [mypackage@Foobar(bar = "fizzbuzz")]
    public myMethod() => () { ... }
}
```

Attribute invocations must be placed in `[ ... ]` block and separated by commas. Any fields/parameters being populated
must be assigned by name within a `( ... )` scope following the attribute name. The `( ... )` block can be omitted if no
parameters are being passed. Ordering of parameters is not important.

Note that attribute invocations are persisted in .meta files, including the final computed value of any field-defining
expressions.

## TODO

- Allow "repeated" attributes on the same method (i.e. the same type of attribute appearing more than once)
- Support attaching attributes to class and field declarations
- Persist attributes at run-time and allow access to them
- Ensure a less-visible attribute type can't be exposed by a more visible method/field/class
- Allow omitting the field name from an attribute invocation if the attribute type only has one field
